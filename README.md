# Transformer-guided diffusion for modeling sets

Transformer-guided variational diffusion model for class- and context-conditional generative modeling of and simulation-based inference on set data.

## TODO:

- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Add class-conditioning
- [X] Fix classifier-free generation; add unconditional dropout
- [ ] Add ELBO and likelihood evaluation
- [ ] Figure out why identity encoder/decoder is not working
- [ ] Gracefully make flash attention optional
