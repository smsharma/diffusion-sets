# Transformer-guided diffusion for modeling sets

Transformer-guided variational diffusion model for class- and context-conditional generative modeling of and simulation-based inference on set data.

## TODO:

- [X] Refactor
- [X] Add class-conditioning
- [X] Fix classifier-free generation; add unconditional dropout
- [X] Add ELBO and likelihood evaluation
- [ ] Gracefully make flash attention optional
